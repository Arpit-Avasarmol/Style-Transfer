**Neural-Style-Transfer**
This repo contains the implementation of Neural style transfer algorithm using Pre-trained VGG-19 architecture

**Testing**
To run this program on your sample content-style pair, just replace the content and style image of the repo with the image of your choice. The program will run 4000 iterations and output the resultant ater every 500th execution. You can edit these details in the file containing the code.

To perform style transfer run: python styleTransferProject.ipynb

**Some Outputs:**
You can see the output at the end in the ipynb file
